                                <p>After college, I was drawn to a career in media production as it seemed to provide a perfect blend of creativity, versatility and entrepreneurship. Ten years, two media-related degrees and three international moves later, I'm now working as a freelance producer and motion graphics designer in the advertising industry. Throughout the past years, I had the opportunity to work on films, TV productions and branded video content - projects that 19-year old me would have been super excited about. But instead of excitement, I started feeling increasingly frustrated in my job and with my career choices. As I was grappling with what felt like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis" alt="Wikipedia article on Quarter-life crisis" target="_blank">quarter-life crisis</a>, I learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai" alt="Wikipedia article on ikigai" target="_blank">ikigai</a>, a Japanese concept meaning  "a reason for being" which can serve as some sort of compass to navigate both career and life decisions. </p>

                                <p class="new_paragraph">And there was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/des_Pudels_Kern" alt="Wikipedia article on the expression The poodle's core" target="_blank">'the poodle's core'</a>: Not only had I not found my ikigai yet, but I also realized that most likely, I wouldn't find it in film and video production <i>(unless maybe David Attenborough called asking me to produce the next Blue Planet).</i><br>
                                Following that eureka moment, I knew that I had to explore other career routes. So I started my quest for a new career <b class="highlight">by addressing ikigai's four defining questions</b>...</p>

                            <p class="cycle_text activeText" id="need_text">This felt like the most pressing question for me to address since it is very important for me to find a meaningful career, i.e. do work that helps others in some way. I also felt that this was where I saw the most discrepancy between my goals and my current career - cause let's be honest, advertising and entertainment is not really top of the 'What the world needs'-list. Through my research, I came to learn about effective altruism and discovered the incredibly inspiring website <a href="https://80000hours.org/" alt="80,000 hours website" target="_blank">80,000 hours</a>: An eye-opening online resource that provides advice on careers with positive social impact. I devoured this website from top to bottom. And in doing so, I realized the multiple ways in which a career in tech can have a positive social impact and can be used to help others. My excitement for the tech industry was further spurred, when I discovered the <a href="https://techforgoodhub.co.uk/tech-for-good" alt="article on tech for good" target="_blank">Tech for Good</a> movement and learned about tech enterprises that improve education, strengthen communities, increase inclusivity and much more.<br>The idea of designing, building and using tech to drive social change excited me tremendously and looking ahead in our digital future, I believe it is exactly <b class="highlight">what the world needs</b>.
                            </p>
                            <p class="cycle_text hidden" id="love_text">As someone who loved both maths and arts at college, I always felt that my passion is somewhat torn between my left and right brain side. While I always enjoyed solving mathematical and analytical problems, I didn't start a career in math as I feared a lack of creative work and vice versa - the compromise was a career in media which eventually left neither brain side fully satisfied. However, working in media production helped me to discover one thing that I truly love: building things. From complex Excel project plans to motion graphics compositions - I could spend days designing a system and then working out the software to bring this brainchild to life. As a motion graphics designer, I frequently find myself in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" alt="Wikipedia article on flow state" target="_blank">flow state</a> where I work on compositions for hours while completely losing track of time. I also love the constant learning process that is required to build new things in different ways. You can imagine my excitement when I discovered that coding combines all these <b class="highlight">things I love doing</b>.<br>On top of that, I was amazed and grateful when I discovered the numerous collaborative and open-source learning opportunities that are available within the coding community. I very much enjoy participating in coding events and I'm excited about the idea of diving deeper into the coding community as a student and eventually as a mentor. </p>
                            <p class="cycle_text hidden" id="good_text">When I first started with coding, I still had doubts if I could be any good in a long-term programming career. I always thought of myself as a people person who likes working in teams and thrives when collaborating with others. My idea of coding was somewhat the opposite of teamwork as I had always considered it as a just-you-and-your-computer kind of thing. However, visiting FAC and other coding meetups over the past few months, I've learned that communication and team working skills are tremendously important in this profession. Discovering that coding can be a collaborative exercise helped me gain confidence in becoming a coder myself. Now I feel that my people skills can be an asset when working in web development. Combined with my motivation for lifelong learning and my somewhat stubborn persistence when facing logical challenges, I do feel that <b class="highlight">I could become good at coding</b>.</p>
                            <p class="cycle_text hidden" id="paid_text">Learning an 'employable' skill that is in demand in the future job market, was another important criteria in my career search. The industry I'm currently working in is afflicted with nepotism and often it's more about 'who you know' and what namely credits you have on your CV, rather than your skills and merit. I do realise that networking and soft skills are important in any job. But as someone who enjoys learning and building new skills, I am keen to build 'career capital' that consists of both soft and hard skills.<br>Looking at different job market projections and skill gap reports, I quickly realised that coding skills - JavaScript skills in particular -  are increasingly in demand. I also found FAC's own employment statistics (as presented at one of your opening evenings) very encouraging and reassuring in that regard. As a freelancer with irregular and little income, investing time in education at the cost of paid opportunities is a huge decision for me and sometimes can feel a bit like a gamble. Knowing that coding is something that I <b class="highlight">very likely can be employed and paid for</b> is extremely reassuring and helps me to stay focused.</p>

The anxiety and regrets I had in regards to career choices gradually turned into excitement and ambition to learn more and more and more. And when I learned about FAC, this excitement was turned up a few notches.

                            <p class="reasons_text_left">When I went to my first FAC meetup in December as a complete novice, I was a bit anxious about going to a coding meetup, having just started on freecodecamp. But I immediately felt welcome and to my surprise, not out of place at all. In every meetup since then and in the gitter chat, I've experienced FAC as an <span class="highlight">extremely outgoing, helpful and diverse</span> community of like-minded people.  And in every article I read about FAC, alumni and students highlighted the strong sense of community in and outside the course. Growing up in a very close-knit neighbourhood collective (not quite a commune, but half the way there), a feeling of community was always something that I've missed in London. So the idea of becoming part of a community that is all about learning together, helping each other and building long-standing relationships, immediately caught my interest. For me, this is where FAC differs the most from any other coding bootcamp and why I am so much more excited about it. I don't see it as a one-off 16-week thing, but an opportunity to become part of an <span class="highlight">educational, professional and social network</span> during and beyond the bootcamp.

                            <p class="reasons_text_right">As mentioned above, it's very important for me to find a career that allows me to do work that helps others and the Tech for Good community was a huge inspiration for me to start coding. This is why I was particularly excited when I learned that <span class="highlight">working with non-profit organisations</span> is a key part of the FAC curriculum. I also found it very interesting and inspiring to learn about the different partnerships and collaborations associated with FAC, such as Yalla Cooperative and Intersticia. These initiatives illustrate that FAC fosters the kind of <span class="highlight">work opportunities that I'm most interested in</span>. As a video producer, I've always enjoyed creating content for charities and social-good startups. In the future, I hope that I can continue using my video production skills as well as my coding skills to help social enterprises. Doing so even while I'm still learning to be a web developer would be an amazing opportunity that I'd highly appreciate.

                            <p class="reasons_text_left">Throughout the FAC's regular meetups and the part-time short course, I had a chance to practice pair programming on multiple occasions. This was an eye-opening experience for me, as I always presumed that coding was primarily a solitary exercise. With pair programming, I learned that coding can be very <span class="highlight">collaborative and challenging in two very different ways</span>:<br>1) finding solutions for coding challenges and <br>2) sharing my thoughts in 'code lingo' with fellow coders. <br>I believe that both challenges require different skill sets and are equally important. I thoroughly enjoy pair programming as I genuinely like working in teams and I found that it consolidated my own learning tremendously. Eventually, I hope to integrate this practice into my professional life. Hence, I was very excited when I learned that FAC students do pair programming most of the time - which provides plenty of time to hone both of those skill sets.</p>
                            <p class="new_paragraph reasons_text_left">
                                Another point that FAC students and alumni highlighted to me was that the course requires a fair amount of <span class="highlight">self-initiated learning</span>, i.e. instead of spoon feeding information, students are asked to research topics and solutions on their own. As a self-taught motion graphics designer, I am very familiar with this kind of learning. I know how often a solution is just one google search away and the only thing that keeps you from it is your own ability to formulate the right question. Therefore, I find that <span class="highlight">research skills are invaluable</span> and from my understanding, the FAC curriculum provides a perfect framework to hone those research skills. As I'm an experienced, persistent self-learner, I have no doubt that this teaching approach fits well with my own nature.

                            <p class="reasons_text_right">When I first heard about FAC, I was amazed by the idea of a self-sustainable, accessible education programme. All too often, education seems to be this tuition-heavy privilege that impedes diversity in all walks of life. That's why I find that enterprises fostering accessibility and inclusivity in education are extremely valuable. I cherish the idea that <span class="highlight">I could help maintain and foster</span> such an initiative as a FAC mentor and alumni. I'm already very grateful of the free support that I've received from FAC thus far <i>(in the meetups, the gitter chat and the part-time course)</i>, and I would welcome the opportunity to turn this appreciation into an actual contribution and <span class="highlight">provide similar support to others</span>. Having mentored students at my former university, I believe that I can contribute to the team with my own experience.

                                I also feel that "near-peer" mentorship has a multitude of other benefits: cooperating with other like-minded people, being involved in a vibrant learning environment and consolidating my own knowledge, just to name a few.  I'm very excited about FAC's plans to extend their activities to other countries, and <span class="highlight">I'd love to play an active role</span> in it's national and international growth.
